> **摘要:** Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is a challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and of a susceptible audience. This is particularly so with younger children, who are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5 different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in real-world educational settings.

> **摘要:** People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI.

> **摘要:** Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information, assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates, preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness, Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness across diverse scenarios.

> **摘要:** With its features of remix, TikTok is the designated platform for meme-making and dissemination. Creative combinations of video, emoji, and filters allow for an endless stream of memes and trends animated by sound. The platform has focused its moderation on upholding physical safety, hence investing in the detection of harmful challenges. In response to the DSA, TikTok implemented opt-outs for personalized feeds and features allowing users to report illegal content. At the same time, the platform remains subject to scrutiny. Centering on the role of sound and its intersections with ambiguous memes, the presented research probed right-wing extremist formations relating to the 2024 German state elections. The analysis evidences how the TikTok sound infrastructure affords a sustained presence of xenophobic content, often cloaked through vernacular modes of communication. These cloaking practices benefit from a sound infrastructure that affords the ongoing posting of user-generated sounds that instantly spread through the use-this-sound button. Importantly, these sounds are often not clearly recognizable as networkers of extremist content. Songs that do contain hateful lyrics are not eligible for personalized feeds, however, they remain online where they profit from intersecting with benign meme trends, rendering them visible in search results.

> **摘要:** Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

> **摘要:** According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3 percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

> **摘要:** Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash. The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems (Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

> **摘要:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should also result in better research after being executed. To test whether AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas, either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100 hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas in the absence of execution outcomes.

> **摘要:** ''TikTok, Do Your Thing'' is a viral trend where users attempt to identify strangers they see in public via information crowd-sourcing. The trend started as early as 2021 and users typically engage with it for romantic purposes (similar to a ''Missed Connections'' personal advertisement). This practice includes acts of surveillance and identification in the public sphere, although by peers rather than governments or corporations. To understand users' reactions to this trend we conducted a qualitative analysis of 60 TikTok videos and 1,901 user comments. Of the 60 videos reviewed, we find 19 individuals were successfully identified. We also find that while there were comments expressing disapproval (n=310), more than double the number expressed support (n=883). Supportive comments demonstrated genuine interest and empathy, reflecting evolving conceptions of community and algorithmic engagement. On the other hand, disapproving comments highlighted concerns about inappropriate relationships, stalking, consent, and gendered double standards. We discuss these insights in relation to the normalization of interpersonal surveillance, online stalking, and as an evolution of social surveillance to offer a new perspective on user perceptions surrounding interpersonal surveillance and identification in the public sphere.

> **摘要:** Smartphone location data have transformed urban mobility research, providing unprecedented insights into how people navigate and interact in cities. However, leveraging location data at scale presents methodological challenges. Accurately identifying individuals' home and work locations is critical for a range of applications, including commuting analysis, unemployment estimation, and urban accessibility studies. Despite their widespread use, home-work detection methods lack a standardized framework that accounts for differing data quality and that is validated against ground-truth observations. This limits the comparability and reproducibility of results across studies and datasets. In this paper, we present HoWDe, a robust algorithm for identifying home and work locations from mobility data, explicitly designed to handle missing data and varying data quality across individuals. Using two unique ground-truth datasets comprising over 5100 individuals from more than 80 countries, HoWDe achieves home and work detection accuracies of up to 97% and 88%, respectively, with consistent performance across countries and demographic groups. We examine how parameter choices shape the trade-off between accuracy and user retention, and demonstrate how these methodological decisions influence downstream applications such as employment estimation and commuting pattern analysis. By supporting in-house pre-processing through a transparent and validated pipeline, HoWDe also facilitates the sharing of privacy-preserving mobility data. Together, our tools and findings establish methodological standards that support more robust, scalable, and reproducible mobility research at both individual and urban scales.

> **摘要:** This paper develops a formal game-theoretic model to examine how protocol mutability disrupts cooperative mining behaviour in blockchain systems. Using a repeated game framework with stochastic rule shocks, we show that even minor uncertainty in institutional rules increases time preference and induces strategic deviation. Fixed-rule environments support long-term investment and stable equilibrium strategies; in contrast, mutable protocols lead to short-termism, higher discounting, and collapse of coordinated engagement. Simulation results identify instability zones in the parameter space where rational mining gives way to extractive or arbitrage conduct. These findings support an Austrian economic interpretation: calculability requires rule stability. Institutional noise undermines the informational basis for productive action. We conclude that protocol design must be treated as a constitutional economic constraint, not a discretionary variable, if sustainable cooperation is to emerge in decentralised systems.

> **摘要:** Scientific progress depends on novel ideas, but current reward systems often fail to recognize them. Many existing metrics conflate novelty with popularity, privileging ideas that fit existing paradigms over those that challenge them. This study develops a theory-driven framework to better understand how different types of novelty emerge, take hold, and receive recognition. Drawing on network science and theories of discovery, we introduce a triadic typology: Pioneers, who introduce entirely new topics; Mavericks, who recombine distant concepts; and Vanguards, who reinforce weak but promising connections. We apply this typology to a dataset of 41,623 articles in the interdisciplinary field of philanthropy and nonprofit studies, linking novelty types to five-year citation counts using mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Results show that novelty is not uniformly rewarded. Pioneer efforts are foundational but often overlooked. Maverick novelty shows consistent citation benefits, particularly rewarded when it displaces prior focus. Vanguard novelty is more likely to gain recognition when it strengthens weakly connected topics, but its citation advantage diminishes as those reinforced nodes become more central. To enable fair comparison across time and domains, we introduce a simulated baseline model. These findings improve the evaluation of innovations, affecting science policy, funding, and institutional assessment practices.

> **摘要:** While the capabilities and utility of AI systems have advanced, rigorous norms for evaluating these systems have lagged. Grand claims, such as models achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions. At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and the claims being made.

> **摘要:** The potential of Generative AI (GenAI) for generating feedback in computing education has been the subject of numerous studies. However, there is still limited research on how computing students engage with this feedback and to what extent it supports their problem-solving. For this reason, we built a custom web application providing students with Python programming tasks, a code editor, GenAI feedback, and compiler feedback. Via a think-aloud protocol including eye-tracking and a post-interview with 11 undergraduate students, we investigate (1) how much attention the generated feedback received from learners and (2) to what extent the generated feedback is helpful (or not). In addition, students' attention to GenAI feedback is compared with that towards the compiler feedback. We further investigate differences between students with and without prior programming experience. The findings indicate that GenAI feedback generally receives a lot of visual attention, with inexperienced students spending twice as much fixation time. More experienced students requested GenAI less frequently, and could utilize it better to solve the given problem. It was more challenging for inexperienced students to do so, as they could not always comprehend the GenAI feedback. They often relied solely on the GenAI feedback, while compiler feedback was not read. Understanding students' attention and perception toward GenAI feedback is crucial for developing educational tools that support student learning.

> **摘要:** Minimal infrastructure requirements make LoRa suitable for service delivery in remote areas. Additionally, web applications have become a de-facto standard for modern service delivery. However, Long Range (LoRa) fails to enable HTTP access due to its limited bandwidth, payload size limitations, and high collisions in multi-user setups. We propose LoRaConnect to enable HTTP access over LoRa. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which client devices connect and access HTTP resources over LoRa backhaul. It implements caching and synchronization mechanisms to address LoRa's aforementioned limitations. It also implements a message-slicing method in the application layer to overcome LoRa's payload limitations. We evaluate the proposed system using actual hardware in three experimental setups to assess the baseline performance, ideal scenario, and practical application scenario with Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). Additionally, it implements a ping operation to demonstrate Internet capability and extensible nature. LoRaWeb achieves an average throughput of 1.18 KB/S approximately, with an access delay of only 1.3 S approximately for a 1.5KB webpage in the baseline setup. Moreover, it achieves an access delay of approximately 6.7 S for a 10KB webpage in the ideal case and an average end-to-end delay of only 612 ms approximately in the FHSS-based setup. Comparison with benchmark suggests multi-fold improvement.

> **摘要:** This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering, validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

> **摘要:** Record matching is the task of identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity across datasets. While most existing models optimize for accuracy, fairness has become an important concern due to the potential for unequal outcomes across demographic groups. Prior work typically focuses on binary outcomes evaluated at fixed decision thresholds. However, such evaluations can miss biases in matching scores--biases that persist across thresholds and affect downstream tasks. We propose a threshold-independent framework for measuring and reducing score bias, defined as disparities in the distribution of matching scores across groups. We show that several state-of-the-art matching methods exhibit substantial score bias, even when appearing fair under standard threshold-based metrics. To address this, we introduce two post-processing score calibration algorithms. The first, calib, aligns group-wise score distributions using the Wasserstein barycenter, targeting demographic parity. The second, ccalib, conditions on predicted labels to further reduce label-dependent biases, such as equal opportunity. Both methods are model-agnostic and require no access to model training data. calib also offers theoretical guarantees, ensuring reduced bias with minimal deviation from original scores. Experiments across real-world datasets and matching models confirm that calib and ccalib substantially reduce score bias while minimally impacting model accuracy.

> **摘要:** The large-scale integration of robots in agriculture offers many promises for enhancing sustainability and increasing food production. The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.

> **摘要:** This paper investigates how a popular Text-to-Image (T2I) model represents people from 208 different nationalities when prompted to generate images of individuals engaging in typical activities. Two scenarios were developed, and 644 images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities. The results show that in one scenario, 52.88% of images, and in the other, 27.4%, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. A statistically significant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and regions. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain areas, particularly the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A notable association with income groups was also found. CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1 mini were used to measure alignment scores between generated images and 3320 prompts and captions, with findings indicating statistically significant higher scores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario. The study also examined revised prompts, finding that the word "traditional" was added by the model to 88.46% of prompts for one scenario. These findings provide valuable insights into T2I models' representation of individuals across different countries, demonstrating how the examined model prioritizes traditional characteristics despite their impracticality for the given activities.
