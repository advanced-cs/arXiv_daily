> **摘要:** Urban greenery is often linked to better health, yet findings from past research have been inconsistent. One reason is that official greenery metrics measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits. We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery, prescription costs could fall by up to {\pounds}3.15 million each year. These results suggest that greenery seen in daily life may be more relevant than public yet secluded greenery, and that official metrics commonly used in the literature have important limitations.

> **摘要:** The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has significantly reshaped education, sparking debates about their impact on learning outcomes and academic integrity. While prior research highlights opportunities and risks, there remains a lack of quantitative analysis of student behavior when completing assignments. Understanding how these tools influence real-world academic practices, particularly assignment preparation, is a pressing and timely research priority. This study addresses this gap by analyzing survey responses from 388 university students, primarily from Russia, including a subset of international participants. Using the XGBoost algorithm, we modeled predictors of ChatGPT usage in academic assignments. Key predictive factors included learning habits, subject preferences, and student attitudes toward AI. Our binary classifier demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving 80.1\% test accuracy, with 80.2\% sensitivity and 79.9\% specificity. The multiclass classifier achieved 64.5\% test accuracy, 64.6\% weighted precision, and 64.5\% recall, with similar training scores, indicating potential data scarcity challenges. The study reveals that frequent use of ChatGPT for learning new concepts correlates with potential overreliance, raising concerns about long-term academic independence. These findings suggest that while generative AI can enhance access to knowledge, unchecked reliance may erode critical thinking and originality. We propose discipline-specific guidelines and reimagined assessment strategies to balance innovation with academic rigor. These insights can guide educators and policymakers in ethically and effectively integrating AI into education.

> **摘要:** Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming education, redefining the role of trainers and coaches in learning environments. In our study, we explore how AI integrates into the design process of learning materials, assessing its impact on efficiency, pedagogical quality, and the evolving role of human trainers and coaches. Through qualitative interviews with professionals in education and corporate training, we identify the following key topics: trainers and coaches increasingly act as facilitators and content moderators rather than primary creators, efficiency gains allow for a stronger strategic focus but at the same time the new tools require new skills. Additionally, we analyze how the anthropomorphism of AI shapes user trust and expectations. From these insights, we derive how tools based on GenAI can successfully be implemented for trainers and coaches on an individual, organizational, systemic, and strategic level.

> **摘要:** Poor posture has become an increasingly prevalent concern due to students and workers spending extended amounts of time sitting at a desk. To address this issue, we developed PoseTrack, a mobile application that uses a Raspberry Pi Camera and Mediapipe Pose landmarks to monitor the user\'s posture and provide real time feedback. The system detects poor posture, including forward lean, slouching, hunched shoulders, crossed legs, etc. Some challenges we faced were obtaining posture data, transferring data from the Raspberry Pi to the App, and safely storing user data. We used a Flask server to pass data from the Raspberry Pi to the mobile application, Firebase to store user data, and the Flutter framework to create the app. To test the analysis system viability, we designed an experiment that tested the system accuracy across several different perspectives and postures. The results indicate that the system is able to effectively detect poor posture whenever the user\'s joints are not blocked by the table or their limbs. The results demonstrate the potential for the system to be further improved and used on a larger scale for poor posture monitoring.

> **摘要:** In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi. As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes, are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable. Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate students' curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information.

> **摘要:** There is, in some quarters, concern about high-level machine intelligence and superintelligent AI coming up in a few decades, bringing with it significant risks for humanity. In other quarters, these issues are ignored or considered science fiction. We wanted to clarify what the distribution of opinions actually is, what probability the best experts currently assign to high-level machine intelligence coming up within a particular time-frame, which risks they see with that development, and how fast they see these developing. We thus designed a brief questionnaire and distributed it to four groups of experts in 2012/2013. The median estimate of respondents was for a one in two chance that high-level machine intelligence will be developed around 2040-2050, rising to a nine in ten chance by 2075. Experts expect that systems will move on to superintelligence in less than 30 years thereafter. They estimate the chance is about one in three that this development turns out to be 'bad' or 'extremely bad' for humanity.

> **摘要:** We have convinced ourselves that the way to make AI safe is to make it unsafe. Since 2022, policymakers worldwide have embraced the Regulation Sacrifice - the belief that dismantling safety oversight will deliver security through AI dominance. Fearing China or USA will gain advantage, nations rush to eliminate safeguards that might slow progress. This Essay reveals the fatal flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems. The Regulation Sacrifice persists because it serves powerful interests, not security. Tech companies prefer freedom to accountability. Politicians prefer simple stories to complex truths. This creates mutually assured deregulation, where each nation's sprint for advantage guarantees collective vulnerability. The only way to win is not to play.

> **摘要:** Urban centers undergo social, demographic, and cultural changes that shape public street use and require systematic evaluation of public spaces. This study presents Street Review, a mixed-methods approach that combines participatory research with AI-based analysis to assess streetscape inclusivity. In Montr\'eal, Canada, 28 residents participated in semi-directed interviews and image evaluations, supported by the analysis of approximately 45,000 street-view images from Mapillary. The approach produced visual analytics, such as heatmaps, to correlate subjective user ratings with physical attributes like sidewalk, maintenance, greenery, and seating. Findings reveal variations in perceptions of inclusivity and accessibility across demographic groups, demonstrating that incorporating diverse user feedback can enhance machine learning models through careful data-labeling and co-production strategies. The Street Review framework offers a systematic method for urban planners and policy analysts to inform planning, policy development, and management of public streets.

> **摘要:** Peer assessment has established itself as a critical pedagogical tool in academic settings, offering students timely, high-quality feedback to enhance learning outcomes. However, the efficacy of this approach depends on two factors: (1) the strategic allocation of reviewers and (2) the number of reviews per artifact. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 87 studies (2010--2024) to investigate how reviewer-assignment strategies and the number of reviews per submission impact the accuracy, fairness, and educational value of peer assessment. We identified four common reviewer-assignment strategies: random assignment, competency-based assignment, social-network-based assignment, and bidding. Drawing from both quantitative data and qualitative insights, we explored the trade-offs involved in each approach. Random assignment, while widely used, often results in inconsistent grading and fairness concerns. Competency-based strategies can address these issues. Meanwhile, social and bidding-based methods have the potential to improve fairness and timeliness -- existing empirical evidence is limited. In terms of review count, assigning three reviews per submission emerges as the most common practice. A range of three to five reviews per student or per submission is frequently cited as a recommended spot that balances grading accuracy, student workload, learning outcomes, and engagement.

> **摘要:** The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare systems in low-resource settings, such as Nepal and Ghana, presents transformative opportunities to improve personalized patient care, optimize resources, and address medical professional shortages. This paper presents a survey-based evaluation and insights from Nepal and Ghana, highlighting major obstacles such as data privacy, reliability, and trust issues. Quantitative and qualitative field studies reveal critical metrics, including 85% of respondents identifying ethical oversight as a key concern, and 72% emphasizing the need for localized governance structures. Building on these findings, we propose a draft Responsible AI (RAI) Framework tailored to resourceconstrained environments in these countries. Key elements of the framework include ethical guidelines, regulatory compliance mechanisms, and contextual validation approaches to mitigate bias and ensure equitable healthcare outcomes.

> **摘要:** Peer grading has emerged as a scalable solution for assessment in large and online classrooms, offering both logistical efficiency and pedagogical value. However, designing effective peer-grading systems remains challenging due to persistent concerns around accuracy, fairness, reliability, and student engagement. This paper presents a systematic review of 122 peer-reviewed studies on peer grading spanning over four decades. Drawing from this literature, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes peer grading systems along two key dimensions: (1) evaluation approaches and (2) reviewer weighting strategies. We analyze how different design choices impact grading accuracy, fairness, student workload, and learning outcomes. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each method. Notably, we found that formative feedback -- often regarded as the most valuable aspect of peer assessment -- is seldom incorporated as a quality-based weighting factor in summative grade synthesis techniques. Furthermore, no single reviewer weighting strategy proves universally optimal; each has its trade-offs. Hybrid strategies that combine multiple techniques could show the greatest promise. Our taxonomy offers a practical framework for educators and researchers aiming to design peer grading systems that are accurate, equitable, and pedagogically meaningful.

> **摘要:** Whether and how to govern AI is no longer a question of technical regulation. It is a question of constitutional authority. Across jurisdictions, algorithmic systems now perform functions once reserved to public institutions: allocating welfare, determining legal status, mediating access to housing, employment, and healthcare. These are not merely administrative operations. They are acts of rule. Yet the dominant models of AI governance fail to confront this reality. The European approach centers on rights-based oversight, presenting its regulatory framework as a principled defense of human dignity. The American model relies on decentralized experimentation, treating fragmentation as a proxy for democratic legitimacy. Both, in different ways, evade the structural question: who authorizes algorithmic power, through what institutions, and on what terms. This Article offers an alternative. Drawing from early modern Reformed political thought, it reconstructs a constitutional framework grounded in covenantal authority and the right of lawful resistance. It argues that algorithmic governance must rest on three principles. First, that all public power must be lawfully delegated through participatory authorization. Second, that authority must be structured across representative communities with the standing to consent, contest, or refuse. Third, that individuals retain a constitutional right to resist systems that impose orthodoxy or erode the domain of conscience. These principles are then operationalized through doctrinal analysis of federalism, nondelegation, compelled speech, and structural accountability. On this view, the legitimacy of algorithmic governance turns not on procedural safeguards or policy design, but on whether it reflects a constitutional order in which power is authorized by the governed, constrained by law, and answerable to those it affects.

> **摘要:** Nudge strategies are effective tools for promoting sustainable behaviour, but their impact depends on individual preferences. By emulating human decision-making, large language models (LLMs) offer a cost-effective route for tailoring nudges without extensive behavioural datasets, yet this potential remains unexplored. Focusing on aviation, we use LLMs to design personalized decoy-based nudge strategies that encourage air travellers to voluntarily offset CO$_2$ emissions from flights, and validate their efficacy through 3495 surveys from China, Germany, India, Singapore, and the United States. Results show that LLM-informed personalized nudges are more effective than uniform settings, raising offsetting rates by 3-7$\%$ and yielding an additional 2.3 million tonnes of CO$_2$ mitigated annually in aviation. This improvement is driven primarily by increased participation among sceptical travellers with low trust in offset programmes. Our study highlights the potential of LLM-driven personalized nudging strategies for boosting offsetting behaviours to accelerate aviation decarbonization.

> **摘要:** This paper explores integrating microlearning strategies into university curricula, particularly in computer science education, to counteract the decline in class attendance and engagement in US universities after COVID. As students increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures, traditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and effectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable units, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational outcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and scenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like algorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing practice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to create such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of supplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain essential in guiding and shaping the learning process. This AI-enhanced approach ensures course content is kept current with the latest research and technology, with educators providing context and insights. By examining AI capabilities in microlearning, this study shows the potential to transform educational practices and outcomes in computer science, offering a practical model for combining advanced technology with established teaching methods.

> **摘要:** The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has positioned data governance as a critical concern for responsible AI development. While frameworks exist for conventional AI systems, the potential emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents unprecedented governance challenges. This paper examines data governance challenges specific to AGI, defined as systems capable of recursive self-improvement or self-replication. We identify seven key issues that differentiate AGI governance from current approaches. First, AGI may autonomously determine what data to collect and how to use it, potentially circumventing existing consent mechanisms. Second, these systems may make data retention decisions based on internal optimization criteria rather than human-established principles. Third, AGI-to-AGI data sharing could occur at speeds and complexities beyond human oversight. Fourth, recursive self-improvement creates unique provenance tracking challenges, as systems evolve both themselves and how they process data. Fifth, ownership of data and insights generated through self-improvement raises complex intellectual property questions. Sixth, self-replicating AGI distributed across jurisdictions would create unprecedented challenges for enforcing data protection laws. Finally, governance frameworks established during early AGI development may quickly become obsolete as systems evolve. We conclude that effective AGI data governance requires built-in constraints, continuous monitoring mechanisms, dynamic governance structures, international coordination, and multi-stakeholder involvement. Without forward-looking governance approaches specifically designed for systems with autonomous data capabilities, we risk creating AGI whose relationship with data evolves in ways that undermine human values and interests.

> **摘要:** Employment inclusion of people with disabilities remains critically low in Italy, with only 3.5% employed nationally despite mandatory hiring quotas. Traditional manual matching processes require 30-60 minutes per candidate, creating bottlenecks that limit service capacity. Our goal is to develop and validate a production-ready machine learning system for disability employment matching that integrates social responsibility requirements while maintaining human oversight in decision-making. We employed participatory requirements engineering with Centro per l'Impiego di Villafranca di Verona professionals. The system implements a seven-model ensemble with parallel hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. Multi-dimensional scoring combines semantic compatibility, geographic distance, and employment readiness assessment. The system achieves 90.1% F1-score and sub-100ms response times while processing 500,000 candidate-company combinations in under 10 minutes. Expert validation confirms 60-100% capacity increases for employment centers. The LightGBM ensemble shows optimal performance with 94.6-second training time. Thus, advanced AI systems can successfully integrate social responsibility requirements without compromising technical performance. The participatory design methodology provides a replicable framework for developing ethical AI applications in sensitive social domains. The complete system, including source code, documentation, and deployment guides, is openly available to facilitate replication and adaptation by other regions and countries facing similar challenges.

> **摘要:** Business interview preparation demands both solid theoretical grounding and refined soft skills, yet conventional classroom methods rarely deliver the individualized, culturally aware practice employers currently expect. This paper introduces SimInterview, a large language model (LLM)-based simulated multilingual interview training system designed for business professionals entering the AI-transformed labor market. Our system leverages an LLM agent and synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across multiple languages. Built on LLMs (OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, Gemma 3), integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto diffusion-based talking head generation model, and ChromaDB vector databases, our system significantly improves interview readiness across English and Japanese markets. Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging regulatory expectations.

> **摘要:** Traditional end-of-quarter surveys often fail to provide instructors with timely, detailed, and actionable feedback about their teaching. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbots can reimagine the classroom feedback process by engaging students in reflective, conversational dialogues. Through the design and deployment of a three-part system-PromptDesigner, FeedbackCollector, and FeedbackAnalyzer-we conducted a pilot study across two graduate courses at UC Santa Cruz. Our findings suggest that LLM-based feedback systems offer richer insights, greater contextual relevance, and higher engagement compared to standard survey tools. Instructors valued the system's adaptability, specificity, and ability to support mid-course adjustments, while students appreciated the conversational format and opportunity for elaboration. We conclude by discussing the design implications of using AI to facilitate more meaningful and responsive feedback in higher education.

> **摘要:** Child safety continues to be a paramount concern worldwide, with child abduction posing significant threats to communities. This paper presents the development of an edge-based child abduction detection and alert system utilizing a multi-agent framework where each agent incorporates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed on a Raspberry Pi. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of VLMs within individual agents of a multi-agent team, our system is trained to accurately detect and interpret complex interactions involving children in various environments in real-time. The multi-agent system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to a webcam, forming an edge device capable of processing video feeds, thereby reducing latency and enhancing privacy. An integrated alert system utilizes the Twilio API to send immediate SMS and WhatsApp notifications, including calls and messages, when a potential child abduction event is detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves high accuracy in detecting potential abduction scenarios, with near real-time performance suitable for practical deployment. The multi-agent architecture enhances the system's ability to process complex situational data, improving detection capabilities over traditional single-model approaches. The edge deployment ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, making it accessible for widespread use. The proposed system offers a proactive solution to enhance child safety through continuous monitoring and rapid alerting, contributing a valuable tool in efforts to prevent child abductions.

> **摘要:** This position paper argues that embedding the legal "reasonable person" standard in municipal AI systems is essential for democratic and sustainable urban governance. As cities increasingly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) systems, concerns around equity, accountability, and normative legitimacy are growing. This paper introduces the Urban Reasonableness Layer (URL), a conceptual framework that adapts the legal "reasonable person" standard for supervisory oversight in municipal AI systems, including potential future implementations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Drawing on historical analogies, scenario mapping, and participatory norm-setting, we explore how legal and community-derived standards can inform AI decision-making in urban contexts. Rather than prescribing a fixed solution, the URL is proposed as an exploratory architecture for negotiating contested values, aligning automation with democratic processes, and interrogating the limits of technical alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) articulating the conceptual and operational architecture of the URL; (2) specifying participatory mechanisms for dynamic normative threshold-setting; (3) presenting a comparative scenario analysis of governance trajectories; and (4) outlining evaluation metrics and limitations. This work contributes to ongoing debates on urban AI governance by foregrounding pluralism, contestability, and the inherently political nature of socio-technical systems.

> **摘要:** Rural healthcare faces persistent challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and socioeconomic disparities that hinder access to essential services. This study investigates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues in underserved rural areas. We systematically reviewed 109 studies published between 2019 and 2024 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Articles were screened using PRISMA guidelines and Covidence software. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and insights regarding AI implementation in rural healthcare delivery. The findings reveal significant promise for AI applications, such as predictive analytics, telemedicine platforms, and automated diagnostic tools, in improving healthcare accessibility, quality, and efficiency. Among these, advanced AI systems, including Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), offer particularly transformative potential. MFMs integrate diverse data sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation, patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity, reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise. However, barriers remain, including infrastructural limitations, data quality concerns, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in digital infrastructure, and the development of regulatory frameworks. This review offers actionable recommendations and highlights areas for future research to ensure equitable and sustainable integration of AI in rural healthcare systems.

> **摘要:** This paper examines how competing sociotechnical imaginaries of artificial intelligence (AI) risk shape governance decisions and regulatory constraints. Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, we analyse three dominant narrative groups: existential risk proponents, who emphasise catastrophic AGI scenarios; accelerationists, who portray AI as a transformative force to be unleashed; and critical AI scholars, who foreground present-day harms rooted in systemic inequality. Through an analysis of representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance approaches. We argue against speculative dogmatism and for moving beyond deterministic imaginaries toward regulatory strategies that are grounded in pragmatism.

#### [new 025] Navigating the New Landscape: A Conceptual Model for Project-Based Assessment (PBA) in the Age of GenAI
- **分类: cs.CY; cs.AI**

> **摘要:** The rapid integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into higher education presents both opportunities and challenges for assessment design, particularly within Project-Based Assessment (PBA) contexts. Traditional assessment methods often emphasise the final product in the PBA, which can now be significantly influenced or created by GenAI tools, raising concerns regarding product authenticity, academic integrity, and learning validation. This paper advocates for a reimagined assessment model for Project-Based Learning (PBL) or a capstone project that prioritises process-oriented evaluation, multi-modal and multifaceted assessment design, and ethical engagement with GenAI to enable higher-order thinking. The model also emphasises the use of (GenAI-assisted) personalised feedback by a supervisor as an observance of the learning process during the project lifecycle. A use case scenario is provided to illustrate the application of the model in a capstone project setting. The paper concludes with recommendations for educators and curriculum designers to ensure that assessment practices remain robust, learner-centric, and integrity-driven in the evolving landscape of GenAI.

> **摘要:** The quick growth of shops using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has changed digital marketing activities and changed how businesses interact and reach their consumers. (AI) techniques are reshaping digital interactions between shops and consumers interact digitally by providing a more efficient and customized experience, fostering deeper engagement and more informed decision-making. This study investigates how (AI) techniques affect consumer interaction and decision-making over purchases with shops that use digital marketing. The partial least squares method was used to evaluate data from a survey with 300 respondents. When consumer engagement mediates this relationship, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have a more favorable impact on purchasing decision-making. Consequently, decision-making is positively impacted through consumer engagement. The findings emphasize that for a bigger impact of the (AI) techniques on decision-making, the consumer must initially interact with the (AI) techniques. This research unveils a contemporary pathway in the field of AI-supported shop engagements and illustrates the distinct impact of (AI) techniques on consumer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty, revolutionizing traditional models of customer-purchase decision-making and shop engagement processes. This study provides previously unheard-of insight, into the revolutionary potential of (AI) techniques in influencing customer behavior and shop relationships

> **摘要:** Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show enormous potential for advancing personalized medicine. However, BCIs also introduce new avenues for cyber-attacks or security compromises. In this article, we analyze the problem and make recommendations for device manufacturers to better secure devices and to help regulators understand where more guidance is needed to protect patient safety and data confidentiality. Device manufacturers should implement the prior suggestions in their BCI products. These recommendations help protect BCI users from undue risks, including compromised personal health and genetic information, unintended BCI-mediated movement, and many other cybersecurity breaches. Regulators should mandate non-surgical device update methods, strong authentication and authorization schemes for BCI software modifications, encryption of data moving to and from the brain, and minimize network connectivity where possible. We also design a hypothetical, average-case threat model that identifies possible cybersecurity threats to BCI patients and predicts the likeliness of risk for each category of threat. BCIs are at less risk of physical compromise or attack, but are vulnerable to remote attack; we focus on possible threats via network paths to BCIs and suggest technical controls to limit network connections.

> **摘要:** Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time, adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments. Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency. Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost, Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500 unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and measurable human impact.

> **摘要:** Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while enhancing interpretability.

> **摘要:** The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection.

> **摘要:** While informal settlements lack focused development and are highly dynamic, the quality of spatial data for these places may be uncertain. This study evaluates the quality and biases of AI-generated Open Building Datasets (OBDs) generated by Google and Microsoft against OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, across diverse global cities including Accra, Nairobi, Caracas, Berlin, and Houston. The Intersection over Union (IoU), overlap analysis and a positional accuracy algorithm are used to analyse the similarity and alignment of the datasets. The paper also analyses the size distribution of the building polygon area, and completeness using predefined but regular spatial units. The results indicate significant variance in data quality, with Houston and Berlin demonstrating high alignment and completeness, reflecting their structured urban environments. There are gaps in the datasets analysed, and cities like Accra and Caracas may be under-represented. This could highlight difficulties in capturing complex or informal regions. The study also notes different building size distributions, which may be indicative of the global socio-economic divide. These findings may emphasise the need to consider the quality of global building datasets to avoid misrepresentation, which is an important element of planning and resource distribution.

> **摘要:** The advancement of computing equipment and the advances in services over the Internet has allowed corporations, higher education, and many other organizations to pursue the shared computing network environment. A requirement for shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to authenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity plane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities can be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and manipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and undermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Cybercrime losses reached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024. For organizations using Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system of choice. In this article, we examine the challenge of security compromises in Active Directory (AD) environments and present effective strategies to prevent credential theft and limit lateral movement by threat actors. Our proposed approaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing significant privilege escalation and theft. We argue that through our illustration of real-world scenarios, tiering can halt lateral movement and advanced cyber-attacks, thus reducing ransom escalation. Our work bridges a gap in existing literature by combining technical guidelines with theoretical arguments in support of tiering, positioning it as a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategy even though it cannot function in isolation. As the hardware advances and the cloud sourced services along with AI is advancing with unprecedented speed, we think it is important for security experts and the business to work together and start designing and developing software and frameworks to classify devices automatically and accurately within the tiered structure.

> **摘要:** This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting human-perceived misery scores from natural language descriptions of real-world scenarios. The task is framed as a regression problem, where the model assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and retrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches consistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of contextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation, we introduce the "Misery Game Show", a novel gamified framework inspired by a television format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal comparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven reasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but also the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified evaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional reasoning tasks beyond standard regression.

> **摘要:** We study the intricate relationships within healthcare systems, focusing on interactions among doctors, departments, and hospitals. Leveraging an evolutionary graph framework, the proposed model emphasizes both intra-layer and inter-layer trust relationships to better understand and optimize healthcare services. The trust-based network facilitates the identification of key healthcare entities by integrating their social and professional interactions, culminating in a trust-based algorithm that quantifies the importance of these entities. Validation with a real-world dataset reveals a strong correlation (0.91) between the proposed trust measures and the ratings of hospitals and departments, though doctor ratings demonstrate skewed distributions due to potential biases. By modeling these relationships and trust dynamics, the framework supports scalable healthcare infrastructure, enabling effective patient referrals, personalized recommendations, and enhanced decision-making pathways.

> **摘要:** In cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchain networks, the decentralized structure enables any user to join and operate across different regions. The criminal entities exploit it by using cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain to facilitate activities such as money laundering, gambling, and ransomware attacks. In recent times, different machine learning-based techniques can detect such criminal elements based on blockchain transaction data. However, there is no provision within the blockchain to deal with such elements. We propose a reputation-based methodology for response to the users detected carrying out the aforementioned illicit activities. We select Algorand blockchain to implement our methodology by incorporating it within the consensus protocol. The theoretical results obtained prove the restriction and exclusion of criminal elements through block proposal rejection and attenuation of the voting power as a validator for such entities. Further, we analyze the efficacy of our method and show that it puts no additional strain on the communication resources.

> **摘要:** It is widely acknowledged that we need to establish where responsibility lies for the outputs and impacts of AI-enabled systems. This is important to achieve justice and compensation for victims of AI harms, and to inform policy and engineering practice. But without a clear, thorough understanding of what "responsibility" means, deliberations about where responsibility lies will be, at best, unfocused and incomplete and, at worst, misguided. Furthermore, AI-enabled systems exist within a wider ecosystem of actors, decisions, and governance structures, giving rise to complex networks of responsibility relations. To address these issues, this paper presents a conceptual framework of responsibility, accompanied with a graphical notation and general methodology for visualising these responsibility networks and for tracing different responsibility attributions for AI. Taking the three-part formulation "Actor A is responsible for Occurrence O," the framework unravels the concept of responsibility to clarify that there are different possibilities of who is responsible for AI, senses in which they are responsible, and aspects of events they are responsible for. The notation allows these permutations to be represented graphically. The methodology enables users to apply the framework to specific scenarios. The aim is to offer a foundation to support stakeholders from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to discuss and address complex responsibility questions in hypothesised and real-world cases involving AI. The work is illustrated by application to a fictitious scenario of a fatal collision between a crewless, AI-enabled maritime vessel in autonomous mode and a traditional, crewed vessel at sea.

> **摘要:** Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB. We have also launched an online time series leaderboard: https://decisionintelligence.github.io/OpenTS/OpenTS-Bench/.

> **摘要:** AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g., neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision that account for particular applications and geographies.

> **摘要:** As governments worldwide increasingly adopt digital tools to enhance citizen engagement and service delivery, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a pivotal advancement in public administration. This study examines the impact of AI-assisted interactions on the quality of communication between citizens and civil servants, focusing on key dimensions such as Satisfaction, Politeness, Ease of Understanding, Feeling Heard, Trust, and Empathy from the citizens' perspective, and Clarity, Politeness, Responsiveness, Respect, Urgency, and Empathy from the civil servants' perspective. Utilizing a questionnaire-based experimental design, the research involved citizens and civil servants who evaluated both original and AI-modified communication samples across five interaction types: Service Requests, Policy Inquiries, Complaints, Suggestions, and Emergency Concerns. Statistical analyses revealed that AI modifications significantly enhanced most communication dimensions for both citizens and civil servants. Specifically, AI-assisted responses led to higher satisfaction, politeness, clarity, and trust among citizens, while also improving clarity, politeness, responsiveness, and respect among civil servants. However, AI interventions showed mixed effects on empathy and urgency from the civil servants' perspective, indicating areas for further refinement. The findings suggest that AI has substantial potential to improve citizen-government interactions, fostering more effective and satisfying communication, while also highlighting the need for continued development to address emotional and urgent communication nuances.

>
> **摘要:** This paper is intended to provide an overview of how the evaluation of standards could be applied to entity resolution, or record linkage. Data quality is of critical importance for many AI applications, and the quality of data, particularly on individuals and businesses, depends critically, in turn, on the quality of the match of entities across different files. Getting entity resolution right is important, because high quality data on entities like people or organization are essential to many AI systems; creating high quality data increasingly requires correctly classifying information that comes from different sources as generated by the same entity. But it is also very difficult because data on the same entity that are acquired from different sources are often inconsistent and have to be carefully reconciled. The use of AI, in the form of machine learning methods, is becoming increasingly important because other approaches are less applicable for modern needs. In particular, manual methods to link data are too costly and slow to scale, and probabilistic methods are inappropriate in the increasingly frequent cases where unique identifiers are not available. The particular focus is on Learning Employment Records, which is a high profile example of the value of entity resolution

> **摘要:** To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce Pairit -- an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 63% and allowed humans to engage in 71% less direct text editing. While human-AI teams engaged in 18% more process and content communication, human-human teams engaged in 29% more social and emotional communication. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73% greater productivity per worker and produced higher-quality ad copy, while human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. Field tests of the ad campaigns accumulated ~5M ad impressions and revealed that ads with higher image quality (produced by human-human collaborations) and higher text quality (produced by human-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through rates, view through rates, and cost per click metrics. Together, these results suggest that human collaboration with AI agents significantly reshapes communication patterns and work processes and increases productivity, while improving some dimensions of output quality and deteriorating others. We hope the release of the extensible Pairit platform will accelerate RCTs of human-AI collaboration across a variety of work tasks and contexts.

> **摘要:** We use a large-scale experiment (N=8000) to determine whether GPT-4 can replicate cross-cultural differences in the Big Five, measured using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. We used the US and South Korea as the cultural pair, given that prior research suggests substantial personality differences between people from these two countries. We manipulated the target of the simulation (US vs. Korean), the language of the inventory (English vs. Korean), and the language model (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5). Our results show that GPT-4 replicated the cross-cultural differences for each factor. However, mean ratings had an upward bias and exhibited lower variation than in the human samples, as well as lower structural validity. We provide preliminary evidence that LLMs can aid cross-cultural researchers and practitioners.

> **摘要:** While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners - those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment - perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

> **摘要:** The integration of AI tools into programming education has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, transforming the way programming is taught and learned. This paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art AI tools available for teaching and learning programming, particularly in the context of introductory courses. It highlights the challenges on course design, learning objectives, course delivery and formative and summative assessment, as well as the misuse of such tools by the students. We discuss ways of re-designing an existing course, re-shaping assignments and pedagogy to address the current AI technologies challenges. This example can serve as a guideline for policies for institutions and teachers involved in teaching programming, aiming to maximize the benefits of AI tools while addressing the associated challenges and concerns.
