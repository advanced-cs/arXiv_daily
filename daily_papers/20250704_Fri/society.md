> **摘要:** The AI industry is exploding in popularity, with increasing attention to potential harms and unwanted consequences. In the current digital ecosystem, AI deployments are often the product of AI supply chains (AISC): networks of outsourced models, data, and tooling through which multiple entities contribute to AI development and distribution. AI supply chains lack the modularity, redundancies, or conventional supply chain practices that enable identification, isolation, and easy correction of failures, exacerbating the already difficult processes of responding to ML-generated harms. As the stakeholders participating in and impacted by AISCs have scaled and diversified, so too have the risks they face. In this stakeholder analysis of AI supply chains, we consider who participates in AISCs, what harms they face, where sources of harm lie, and how market dynamics and power differentials inform the type and probability of remedies. Because AI supply chains are purposely invented and implemented, they may be designed to account for, rather than ignore, the complexities, consequences, and risks of deploying AI systems. To enable responsible design and management of AISCs, we offer a typology of responses to AISC-induced harms: recourse, repair, reparation or prevention. We apply this typology to stakeholders participating in a health-care AISC across three stylized markets $\unicode{x2013}$ vertical integration, horizontal integration, free market $\unicode{x2013}$ to illustrate how stakeholder positioning and power within an AISC may shape responses to an experienced harm.

> **摘要:** Immutability is a core design goal of permissionless public blockchain systems. However, rewrites are more common than is normally understood, and the risk of rewrite, cyberattack, exploit or black swan event is also high. Taking the position that strict immutability is neither possible on these networks nor the observed reality, this paper uses thematic analysis of node operator interviews to examine the limits of immutability in light of rewrite events. The end result is a qualitative definition of the conditional immutability found on these networks, which we call Practical Immutability. This is immutability contingent on the legitimate governance demands of the network, where network stakeholders place their trust in the governance topology of a network to lend it legitimacy, and thus manage ledger state.

> **摘要:** Generative AI tools - most notably large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Codex - are rapidly revolutionizing computer science education. These tools can generate, debug, and explain code, thereby transforming the landscape of programming instruction. This paper examines the profound opportunities that AI offers for enhancing computer science education in general, from coding assistance to fostering innovative pedagogical practices and streamlining assessments. At the same time, it highlights challenges including academic integrity concerns, the risk of over-reliance on AI, and difficulties in verifying originality. We discuss what computer science educators should teach in the AI era, how to best integrate these technologies into curricula, and the best practices for assessing student learning in an environment where AI can generate code, prototypes and user feedback. Finally, we propose a set of policy recommendations designed to harness the potential of generative AI while preserving the integrity and rigour of computer science education. Empirical data and emerging studies are used throughout to support our arguments.

> **摘要:** The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality, source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

> **摘要:** The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957 (near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in outcomes.

> **摘要:** Large language Models have only been widely available since 2022 and yet in less than three years have had a significant impact on approaches to education and educational technology. Here we review the domains in which they have been used, and discuss a variety of use cases, their successes and failures. We then progress to discussing how this is changing the dynamic for learners and educators, consider the main design challenges facing LLMs if they are to become truly helpful and effective as educational systems, and reflect on the learning paradigms they support. We make clear that the new interaction paradigms they bring are significant and argue that this approach will become so ubiquitous it will become the default way in which we interact with technologies, and revolutionise what people expect from computer systems in general. This leads us to present some specific and significant considerations for the design of educational technology in the future that are likely to be needed to ensure acceptance by the changing expectations of learners and users.

> **摘要:** Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.

> **摘要:** From viral jokes to a billion-dollar phenomenon, meme coins have become one of the most popular segments in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike utility-focused crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins derive value primarily from community sentiment, making them vulnerable to manipulation. This study presents a cross-chain analysis of the meme coin ecosystem, examining 34,988 tokens across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. We characterize the tokenomics of meme coins and track their growth in a three-month longitudinal analysis. We discover that among high-return tokens (>100%), an alarming 82.6% show evidence of extensive use of artificial growth strategies designed to create a misleading appearance of market interest. These include wash trading and a form of manipulation we define as Liquidity Pool-Based Price Inflation (LPI), where small strategic purchases trigger dramatic price increases. We also find evidence of schemes designed to profit at the expense of investors, such as pump and dumps and rug pulls. In particular, most of the tokens involved had previously experienced wash trading or LPI, indicating how initial manipulations often set the stage for later exploitation. These findings reveal that manipulations are widespread among high-performing meme coins and suggest that their dramatic gains are often likely driven by coordinated efforts rather than natural market dynamics.

> **摘要:** As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate. This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective governance.

> **摘要:** Effective communication in serious illness and palliative care is essential but often under-taught due to limited access to training resources like standardized patients. We present PAL (Palliative Assisted Learning-bot), a conversational system that simulates emotionally nuanced patient interactions and delivers structured feedback grounded in an existing empathy-based framework. PAL supports text and voice modalities and is designed to scaffold clinical skill-building through repeated, low-cost practice. Through a mixed-methods study with 17 U.S. medical trainees and clinicians, we explore user engagement with PAL, evaluate usability, and examine design tensions around modalities, emotional realism, and feedback delivery. Participants found PAL helpful for reflection and skill refinement, though some noted limitations in emotional authenticity and the adaptability of feedback. We contribute: (1) empirical evidence that large language models can support palliative communication training; (2) design insights for modality-aware, emotionally sensitive simulation tools; and (3) implications for systems that support emotional labor, cooperative learning, and AI-augmented training in high-stakes care settings.

> **摘要:** Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.

> **摘要:** The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including both EVENS and Census 2021 (England & Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies both among minority ethnic groups and between minority ethnic groups and non-minority ethnic groups, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in policy-making processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can provide valuable insights into ensuring fairness in machine learning systems.

Unlike traditional rule-based ABM, the proposed framework leverages LLM to enhance agent diversity and realism by generating synthetic population profiles, allocating routine and occasional locations, and simulating personalized routes. Using real-world data, the simulation models individual behaviors and large-scale mobility patterns in Taipei City. Key insights, such as route heat maps and mode-specific indicators, provide urban planners with actionable information for policy-making. Future work focuses on establishing robust validation frameworks to ensure accuracy and reliability in urban planning applications.

> **摘要:** The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

> **摘要:** Artificial intelligence (AI) offers incredible possibilities for patient care, but raises significant ethical issues, such as the potential for bias. Powerful ethical frameworks exist to minimize these issues, but are often developed for academic or regulatory environments and tend to be comprehensive but overly prescriptive, making them difficult to operationalize within fast-paced, resource-constrained environments. We introduce the Scalable Agile Framework for Execution in AI (SAFE-AI) designed to balance ethical rigor with business priorities by embedding ethical oversight into standard Agile-based product development workflows. The framework emphasizes the early establishment of testable acceptance criteria, fairness metrics, and transparency metrics to manage model uncertainty, while also promoting continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of these metrics across the AI lifecycle. A core component of this framework are responsibility metrics using scenario-based probability analogy mapping designed to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust. This ensures that retraining or tuning activities are subject to lightweight but meaningful ethical review. By focusing on the minimum necessary requirements for responsible development, our framework offers a scalable, business-aligned approach to ethical AI suitable for organizations without dedicated ethics teams.

> **摘要:** Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in academic medical settings raises copyright compliance concerns. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute implemented GPT4DFCI, an internal generative AI tool utilizing OpenAI models, that is approved for enterprise use in research and operations. Given (1) the exceptionally broad adoption of the tool in our organization, (2) our research mission, and (3) the shared responsibility model required to benefit from Customer Copyright Commitment in Azure OpenAI Service products, we deemed rigorous copyright compliance testing necessary. Case Description: We conducted a structured red teaming exercise in Nov. 2024, with 42 participants from academic, industry, and government institutions. Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI across four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications, and access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim book dedications and near-exact passages through various strategies. News article extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article reproduction yielded only high-level summaries. Clinical note testing revealed appropriate privacy safeguards. Discussion: The successful extraction of literary content indicates potential copyrighted material presence in training data, necessitating inference-time filtering. Differential success rates across content types suggest varying protective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a copyright-specific meta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation has been in production since Jan. 2025. Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in generative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies. Academic medical institutions deploying generative AI should implement continuous testing protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance.

> **摘要:** Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI, however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI. In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed structure of the generative AI value chain. In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern generative AI.

> **摘要:** According to several empirical investigations, despite enhancing human capabilities, human-AI cooperation frequently falls short of expectations and fails to reach true synergy. We propose a task-driven framework that reverses prevalent approaches by assigning AI roles according to how the task's requirements align with the capabilities of AI technology. Three major AI roles are identified through task analysis across risk and complexity dimensions: autonomous, assistive/collaborative, and adversarial. We show how proper human-AI integration maintains meaningful agency while improving performance by methodically mapping these roles to various task types based on current empirical findings. This framework lays the foundation for practically effective and morally sound human-AI collaboration that unleashes human potential by aligning task attributes to AI capabilities. It also provides structured guidance for context-sensitive automation that complements human strengths rather than replacing human judgment.

> **摘要:** The past decade has seen a surge in public and private applications of life cycle assessment (LCA), accelerated by emerging policies and disclosure practices mandating its use for sustainability impact reporting. Simultaneously, the magnitude and diversity of stakeholder groups affected by decisions informed by LCA have expanded rapidly. This has intensified the need for LCA to be conducted more quickly, accurately, and--crucially--earlier in the technology development cycle, when products and materials can still be readily modified, replaced, or optimized. When applied early, LCA has the potential to guide design choices, steer innovation, and avoid "lock-in" of adverse environmental impacts. However, this growing demand has surfaced several unresolved challenges around best practices for assessing sustainability at early stages of technology development. In this paper, we examine six such controversial topics--(1) appropriate use of LCA, (2) uncertainty assessment, (3) comparison with incumbents, (4) methodological standardization, (5) scale-up from laboratory or pilot data, and (6) stakeholder engagement--selected to highlight key debates from a series of workshop-style discussions convened by the LCA of Emerging Technologies Research Network. Rather than a comprehensive review with definitive conclusions, this paper adopts a Faraday Discussion-style approach to spotlight areas of agreement and disagreement among our network of LCA experts. For each issue, we present a declarative resolution, summarize key arguments for and against it, identify points of consensus, and provide recommendations. We aim to raise awareness of shared challenges in emerging technology assessment and foster more transparent, evidence-based, and context-informed approaches within the LCA community.
