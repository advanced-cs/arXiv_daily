> **摘要:** Artificial intelligence has deeply permeated numerous fields, especially the design area which relies on technology as a tool for innovation. This change naturally extends to the field of design education, which is closest to design practice. This has led to further exploration of the impact of AI on college-level education in the design discipline. This study aims to examine how current design educators perceive the role of AI in college-level design education, their perspectives on integrating AI into teaching and research, and their concerns regarding its potential challenges in design education and research. Through qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with seven faculties in U.S. design colleges, the findings reveal that AI, as a tool and source of information, has become an integral part of design education. AI- derived functionalities are increasingly utilized in design software, and educators are actively incorporating AI as a theoretical framework in their teaching. Educators can guide students in using AI tools, but only if they first acquire a strong foundation in basic design principles and skills. This study also indicates the importance of promoting a cooperative relationship between design educators and AI. At the same time, educators express anticipation for advancements in ethical standards, authenticity, and the resolution of copyright issues related to AI.

> **摘要:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received unprecedented attention in recent years, raising ethical concerns about the development and use of AI technology. In the present article, we advocate that these concerns stem from a blurred understanding of AI, how it can be used, and how it has been interpreted in society. We explore the concept of AI based on three descriptive facets and consider ethical issues related to each facet. Finally, we propose a framework for the ethical assessment of the use of AI.

> **摘要:** Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting) modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a "scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher - a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

> **摘要:** Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology), and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.

> **摘要:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate: 42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure, restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness, followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors such as the one proposed in this study.

> **摘要:** Practitioners building online services and tools often turn to online forums such as Reddit, Law Stack Exchange, and Stack Overflow for legal guidance to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The legal information presented in these forums directly impacts present-day industry practitioner's decisions. Online forums can serve as gateways that, depending on the accuracy and quality of the answers provided, may either support or undermine the protection of privacy and data protection fundamental rights. However, there is a need for deeper investigation into practitioners' decision-making processes and their understanding of legal compliance when seeking for legal information online. Using GDPR's ``legitimate interests'' legal ground for processing personal data as a case study, we investigate how practitioners use online forums to identify common areas of confusion in applying legitimate interests in practice, and evaluate how legally sound online forum responses are. Our analysis found that applying the legal basis of legitimate interest is complex for practitioners, with important implications for how the GDPR is implemented in practice. The legal analysis showed that crowdsourced legal information tends to be legally sound, though sometimes incomplete. We outline recommendations to improve the quality of online forums by ensuring that responses are more legally sound and comprehensive, enabling practitioners to apply legitimate interests effectively in practice and uphold the GDPR.

> **摘要:** The efficient design and management of public green spaces is a key factor in promoting the health and well-being of urban population, as emphasized by the WHO, UNEP, and EEA. These areas serve as the "green lungs" of the urban ecosystem, playing a vital role in enhancing quality of life thanks to the provision of ecosystem services. In this context, the Smart Green City use case in Campobasso municipality, funded by the Italian Ministry of Enterprises (MIMIT), emerges as an innovative model for the sustainable management of green urban areas through the adoption of an advanced system of emerging technologies integrated and interoperable. The project integrates IoT systems and data-driven governance platforms, enabling real-time monitoring of the health status of trees and green areas via a Decision Support System (DSS). It also facilitates the collection and analysis of data from diverse sources, including weather conditions, air quality, soil moisture, pollution levels. The resulting cloud-based platform supports a holistic real time decision making for green urban managers, technical experts and operational staff. It enables intelligent control and management of urban green spaces using Tree Talker sensors, integrated with soil moisture and water potential monitoring systems. Thanks to predictive models based on machine learning algorithms and real time data provided by IoT sensors, irrigation of public parks can be optimized by providing suggestions on when and how much water to apply. Customized alerts layers are also activated warning users when monitored parameters, such as soil temperature, humidity, or water potential, exceed predefined thresholds. This Use Case demonstrates how digitalization, IoT sensors fusion and technological innovation can support sustainable urban governance, fostering environmental resilience and improving citizens quality of life.

#### [replaced 003] How Consistent Are Humans When Grading Programming Assignments?
- **分类: cs.CY**

> **摘要:** Providing consistent summative assessment to students is important, as the grades they are awarded affect their progression through university and future career prospects. While small cohorts are typically assessed by a single assessor, such as the module/class leader, larger cohorts are often assessed by multiple assessors, typically teaching assistants, which increases the risk of inconsistent grading. To investigate the consistency of human grading of programming assignments, we asked 28 participants to each grade 40 CS1 introductory Java assignments, providing grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation; the 40 assignments were split into two batches of 20. The 28 participants were divided into seven groups of four (where each group graded the same 40 assignments) to allow us to investigate the consistency of a group of assessors. In the second batch of 20, we duplicated one assignment from the first to analyse the internal consistency of individual assessors. Our results show that human graders in our study can not agree on the grade to give a piece of student work and are often individually inconsistent, suggesting that the idea of a ``gold standard'' of human grading might be flawed. This highlights that a shared rubric alone is not enough to ensure consistency, and other aspects such as assessor training and alternative grading practices should be explored to improve the consistency of human grading further when grading programming assignments.

#### [replaced 005] The "Who", "What", and "How" of Responsible AI Governance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of (Actor, Stage)-Specific Tools

> **摘要:** The implementation of responsible AI in an organization is inherently complex due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders, each with their unique set of goals and responsibilities across the entire AI lifecycle. These responsibilities are often ambiguously defined and assigned, leading to confusion, miscommunication, and inefficiencies. Even when responsibilities are clearly defined and assigned to specific roles, the corresponding AI actors lack effective tools to support their execution. Toward closing these gaps, we present a systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of the current state of responsible AI tools, focusing on their alignment with specific stakeholder roles and their responsibilities in various AI lifecycle stages. We categorize over 220 tools according to AI actors and stages they address. Our findings reveal significant imbalances across the stakeholder roles and lifecycle stages addressed. The vast majority of available tools have been created to support AI designers and developers specifically during data-centric and statistical modeling stages while neglecting other roles such as institutional leadership, deployers, end-users, and impacted communities, and stages such as value proposition and deployment. The uneven distribution we describe here highlights critical gaps that currently exist in responsible AI governance research and practice. Our analysis reveals that despite the myriad of frameworks and tools for responsible AI, it remains unclear \emph{who} within an organization and \emph{when} in the AI lifecycle a tool applies. Furthermore, existing tools are rarely validated, leaving critical gaps in their usability and effectiveness. These gaps provide a starting point for researchers and practitioners to create more effective and holistic approaches to responsible AI development and governance.

> **摘要:** We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.

> **摘要:** Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.

> **摘要:** Background: Harnessing advanced computing for scientific discovery and technological innovation demands scientists and engineers well-versed in both domain science and computational science and engineering (CSE). However, few universities provide access to both integrated domain science/CSE cross-training and Top-500 High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. National laboratories offer internship opportunities capable of developing these skills. Purpose: This student presents an evaluation of federally-funded postgraduate internship outcomes at a national laboratory. This study seeks to answer three questions: 1) What computational skills, research skills, and professional skills do students improve through internships at the selected national laboratory. 2) Do students gain knowledge in domain science topics through their internships. 3) Do students' career interests change after these internships? Design/Method: We developed a survey and collected responses from past participants of five federally-funded internship programs and compare participant ratings of their prior experience to their internship experience. Findings: Our results indicate that participants improve CSE skills and domain science knowledge, and are more interested in working at national labs. Participants go on to degree programs and positions in relevant domain science topics after their internships. Conclusions: We show that national laboratory internships are an opportunity for students to build CSE skills that may not be available at all institutions. We also show a growth in domain science skills during their internships through direct exposure to research topics. The survey instrument and approach used may be adapted to other studies to measure the impact of postgraduate internships in multiple disciplines and internship settings.

> **摘要:** Language models are extensively evaluated, but correctly interpreting evaluation results requires knowledge of train-test overlap which refers to the extent to which the language model is trained on the very data it is being tested on. The public currently lacks adequate information about train-test overlap: most models have no public train-test overlap statistics, and third parties cannot directly measure train-test overlap since they do not have access to the training data. To make this clear, we document the practices of 30 model developers, finding that just 9 developers report train-test overlap: 4 developers release training data under open-source licenses, enabling the community to directly measure train-test overlap, and 5 developers publish their train-test overlap methodology and statistics. By engaging with language model developers, we provide novel information about train-test overlap for three additional developers. Overall, we take the position that language model developers should publish train-test overlap statistics and/or training data whenever they report evaluation results on public test sets. We hope our work increases transparency into train-test overlap to increase the community-wide trust in model evaluations.

> **摘要:** Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.

> **摘要:** This report provides a detailed comparison between the Safety and Security measures proposed in the EU AI Act's General-Purpose AI (GPAI) Code of Practice (Third Draft) and the current commitments and practices voluntarily adopted by leading AI companies. As the EU moves toward enforcing binding obligations for GPAI model providers, the Code of Practice will be key for bridging legal requirements with concrete technical commitments. Our analysis focuses on the draft's Safety and Security section (Commitments II.1-II.16), documenting excerpts from current public-facing documents that are relevant to each individual measure. We systematically reviewed different document types, such as companies' frontier safety frameworks and model cards, from over a dozen companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and others. This report is not meant to be an indication of legal compliance, nor does it take any prescriptive viewpoint about the Code of Practice or companies' policies. Instead, it aims to inform the ongoing dialogue between regulators and General-Purpose AI model providers by surfacing evidence of industry precedent for various measures. Nonetheless, we were able to find relevant quotes from at least 5 companies' documents for the majority of the measures in Commitments II.1-II.16.

> **摘要:** Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions, such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework, we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently. Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public interest and engagement with scientific content.

> **摘要:** Political advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and influencing electoral outcomes, often through subtle persuasive techniques embedded in broader propaganda strategies. Detecting these persuasive elements is crucial for enhancing voter awareness and ensuring transparency in democratic processes. This paper presents an integrated approach that bridges model development and real-world application through two interconnected studies. First, we introduce a lightweight model for persuasive text detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance in Subtask 3 of SemEval 2023 Task 3 while requiring significantly fewer computational resources and training data than existing methods. Second, we demonstrate the model's practical utility by collecting the Australian Federal Election 2022 Facebook Ads (APA22) dataset, partially annotating a subset for persuasion, and fine-tuning the model to adapt from mainstream news to social media content. We then apply the fine-tuned model to label the remainder of the APA22 dataset, revealing distinct patterns in how political campaigns leverage persuasion through different funding strategies, word choices, demographic targeting, and temporal shifts in persuasion intensity as election day approaches. Our findings not only underscore the necessity of domain-specific modeling for analyzing persuasion on social media but also show how uncovering these strategies can enhance transparency, inform voters, and promote accountability in digital campaigns.

> **摘要:** Traditional recommender systems based on revealed preferences often fail to capture the fundamental duality in user behavior, where consumption choices are driven by both inherent value (enrichment) and instant appeal (temptation). Consequently, these systems may generate recommendations that prioritize short-term engagement over long-lasting user satisfaction. We propose a novel recommender design that explicitly models the tension between enrichment and temptation. We introduce a behavioral model that accounts for how both enrichment and temptation influence user choices, while incorporating the reality of off-platform alternatives. Building on this model, we formulate a novel recommendation objective aligned with maximizing consumed enrichment and prove the optimality of a locally greedy recommendation strategy. Finally, we present an estimation framework that leverages the distinction between explicit user feedback and implicit choice data while making minimal assumptions about off-platform options. Through comprehensive evaluation using both synthetic simulations and real-world data from the MovieLens dataset, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines that ignore temptation dynamics either by assuming revealed preferences or recommending solely based on enrichment. Our work represents a paradigm shift toward more nuanced and user-centric recommender design, with significant implications for developing responsible AI systems that genuinely serve users' long-term interests rather than merely maximizing engagement.
