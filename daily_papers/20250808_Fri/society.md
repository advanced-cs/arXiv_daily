> **摘要:** Computer science education is a dynamic field with many aspects that influence the learner's path. While these aspects are usually studied in depth separately, it is also important to carry out broader large-scale studies that touch on many topics, because they allow us to put different results into each other's perspective. Past large-scale surveys have provided valuable insights, however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g., in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with 18,032 learners from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and exploring a wide range of topics - formal education, learning formats, AI usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and insights into the in-IDE format. The dataset aims to support further research and foster advancements in computer education.

> **摘要:** The discourse about sustainable technology has emerged from the acknowledgment of the environmental collapse we are facing. In this paper, we argue that addressing this crisis requires more than the development of sustainable alternatives to current online services or the optimization of resources using various dashboards and AI. Rather, the focus must shift toward designing technologies that protect us from the consequences of the environmental damages. Among these consequences, wars, genocide and new forms of colonialism are perhaps the most significant. We identify "protection" not in terms of military defense as Western States like to argue, but as part of sovereignty. We seek to define the term of "Resistance Technologies" for such technologies, arguing further that anti-surveillance technologies are a foundational component of sovereignty and must be part of future conversations around sustainability. Finally, our paper seeks to open a discourse with the Computing-within-Limits community and beyond, towards defining other essential aspects or concepts of technologies that we see as core values of "Resistance Technology".

> **摘要:** Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom. Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme. It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots. The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the Metaverse and augmented reality.

> **摘要:** There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However, this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1) prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails, as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source code, datasets and learnings.

> **摘要:** The real-time data collection and automation capabilities offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing and transforming Business Processes (BPs) into IoT-enhanced BPs, showing high potential for improving sustainability. Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM), sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns. However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts, linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs, identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism domain and a case study in healthcare.

> **摘要:** AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate, truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms, political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems, suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.

#### [new 007] The Term 'Agent' Has Been Diluted Beyond Utility and Requires Redefinition

> **摘要:** The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction, learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence. This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while supporting more effective policy development.

> **摘要:** Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

> **摘要:** This study investigates how high school-aged youth engage in algorithm auditing to identify and understand biases in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools they encounter daily. With AI/ML technologies being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters. We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies, empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.

#### [replaced 001] $\texttt{Droid}$: A Resource Suite for AI-Generated Code Detection

> **摘要:** In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages, outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains. Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.

> **摘要:** Despite mounting evidence that women in foreign policy often bear the brunt of online hostility, the extent of online gender bias against diplomats remains unexplored. This paper offers the first global analysis of the treatment of women diplomats on social media. Introducing a multidimensional and multilingual methodology for studying online gender bias, it focuses on three critical elements: gendered language, negativity in tweets directed at diplomats, and the visibility of women diplomats. Our unique dataset encompasses ambassadors from 164 countries, their tweets, and the direct responses to these tweets in 65 different languages. Using automated content and sentiment analysis, our findings reveal a crucial gender bias. The language in responses to diplomatic tweets is only mildly gendered and largely pertains to international affairs and, generally, women ambassadors do not receive more negative reactions to their tweets than men, yet the pronounced discrepancy in online visibility stands out as a significant form of gender bias. Women receive a staggering 66.4% fewer retweets than men. By unraveling the invisibility that obscures women diplomats on social media, we hope to spark further research on online bias in international politics.

> **摘要:** High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. This method offers a scalable, pre-deployment evaluation without requiring student data, but its predictive validity concerning empirical IRT parameters is underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving 7,126 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (physical science, mathematics, and life/earth sciences). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life/earth and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors) and how they might make a question more or less challenging. Overall, our findings establish automated IWF analysis as a valuable supplement to traditional validation, providing an efficient method for initial item screening, particularly for flagging low-difficulty MCQs. Our findings show the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.

> **摘要:** Urban flood risk emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among multiple features related to flood hazard, flood exposure, and social and physical vulnerabilities, along with the complex spatial flood dependence relationships. Existing approaches for characterizing urban flood risk, however, are primarily based on flood plain maps, focusing on a limited number of features, primarily hazard and exposure features, without consideration of feature interactions or the dependence relationships among spatial areas. To address this gap, this study presents an integrated urban flood-risk rating model based on a novel unsupervised graph deep learning model (called FloodRisk-Net). FloodRisk-Net is capable of capturing spatial dependence among areas and complex and nonlinear interactions among flood hazards and urban features for specifying emergent flood risk. Using data from multiple metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, the model characterizes their flood risk into six distinct city-specific levels. The model is interpretable and enables feature analysis of areas within each flood-risk level, allowing for the identification of the three archetypes shaping the highest flood risk within each MSA. Flood risk is found to be spatially distributed in a hierarchical structure within each MSA, where the core city disproportionately bears the highest flood risk. Multiple cities are found to have high overall flood-risk levels and low spatial inequality, indicating limited options for balancing urban development and flood-risk reduction. Relevant flood-risk reduction strategies are discussed considering ways that the highest flood risk and uneven spatial distribution of flood risk are formed.

> **摘要:** Perception occurs when individuals interpret the same information differently. It is a known cognitive phenomenon with implications for bias in human decision-making. Perception, however, remains understudied in machine learning (ML). This is problematic as modern decision flows, whether partially or fully automated by ML applications, always involve human experts. For instance, how might we account for cases in which two experts interpret differently the same deferred instance or explanation from a ML model? Addressing this and similar questions requires first a formulation of perception, particularly, in a manner that integrates with ML-enabled decision flows. In this work, we present a first approach to modeling perception causally. We define perception under causal reasoning using structural causal models (SCMs). Our approach formalizes individual experience as additional causal knowledge that comes with and is used by the expert decision-maker in the form of a SCM. We define two kinds of probabilistic causal perception: structural and parametrical. We showcase our framework through a series of examples of modern decision flows. We also emphasize the importance of addressing perception in fair ML, discussing relevant fairness implications and possible applications.

> **摘要:** Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings, as common to internet-based or blockchain-based platforms. One key challenge that arises is the ability of actors to create multiple fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. In addition, we show that popular measures, liked the famous Gini coefficient, are not Sybil-proof. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in pseudonymous and traditional settings.
