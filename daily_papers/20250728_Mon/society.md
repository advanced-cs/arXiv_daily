> **摘要:** The digitalization of societies raises questions about its sustainability and the socio-technical impacts it generates. Ecological redirection applied to organizations is a field of research aiming for achieving sustainability as a direction, rather than for technical means. Arbitration and renunciation to some digital usage and technologies are investigated. Ecological redirection is, however, not yet addressing concrete methodologies for its implementation in organizations. This paper therefore proposes a protocol to support stakeholders in the ecological redirection of their digital practices. This protocol is based on mapping attachments to digital tools through a multi-disciplinary survey. It then proposes increasing stakeholders' knowledge and skills to prepare a debate on the arbitration of renunciations, and finally, to operationalize the closure/transformation of targeted digital practices. This protocol will be tested in real conditions in different contexts. An empirical study is proposed to measure 1) the fluidity with which participants carry out the protocol, 2) the effectiveness of the protocol in terms of the redirection objective, 3) the socio-technical barriers to the redirection process. The paper concludes on the potential benefits for organizations to better understand both the barriers related to its ecological redirection and the transformative aim of such protocols. This will help them trigger large and radical policies towards a desirable and sustainable society.

> **摘要:** Ear disease contributes significantly to global hearing loss, with recurrent otitis media being a primary preventable cause in children, impacting development. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise for early diagnosis via otoscopic image analysis, but dataset biases and inconsistencies limit model generalizability and reliability. This retrospective study systematically evaluated three public otoscopic image datasets (Chile; Ohio, USA; T\"urkiye) using quantitative and qualitative methods. Two counterfactual experiments were performed: (1) obscuring clinically relevant features to assess model reliance on non-clinical artifacts, and (2) evaluating the impact of hue, saturation, and value on diagnostic outcomes. Quantitative analysis revealed significant biases in the Chile and Ohio, USA datasets. Counterfactual Experiment I found high internal performance (AUC > 0.90) but poor external generalization, because of dataset-specific artifacts. The T\"urkiye dataset had fewer biases, with AUC decreasing from 0.86 to 0.65 as masking increased, suggesting higher reliance on clinically meaningful features. Counterfactual Experiment II identified common artifacts in the Chile and Ohio, USA datasets. A logistic regression model trained on clinically irrelevant features from the Chile dataset achieved high internal (AUC = 0.89) and external (Ohio, USA: AUC = 0.87) performance. Qualitative analysis identified redundancy in all the datasets and stylistic biases in the Ohio, USA dataset that correlated with clinical outcomes. In summary, dataset biases significantly compromise reliability and generalizability of AI-based otoscopic diagnostic models. Addressing these biases through standardized imaging protocols, diverse dataset inclusion, and improved labeling methods is crucial for developing robust AI solutions, improving high-quality healthcare access, and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

> **摘要:** Research on digital degrowth predominantly critiques digital expansion or presents alternative digital practices. Yet, analyzing the link between digital technologies and complexity is crucial to overcome systemic obstacles hindering digital de-escalation. This article presents the different types of links between complexity and computing observed in the literature: the infrastructural complexity inherent in digital technologies, the socio-political complexity induced by them, and finally, the ontological complexity (individual's ways of relating to their environment) hindered by digitization. The paper explores these links to identify ways to reduce infrastructural and socio-political complexities, and to move away from the reductionist paradigm, in order to support digital degrowth. Its development shows that complexity induces ratchet effects (i.e. irreversibilities in the development of a technique in a society), rendering degrowth efforts difficult to handle by individuals. Therefore, strategies to overcome these barriers are proposed, suggesting that bottom-up simplification approaches stand a greater chance of making alternatives emerge from different stakeholders (including users). This digital shift assumes the development of methods and technical tools that enable individuals to disengage from their attachments to digital habits and infrastructure, opening a substantial field of study.

> **摘要:** The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600 responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she' pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use. Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

>
> **摘要:** The report presents a comprehensive set of five recommendations to reduce language barriers within the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Research Ecosystem, promoting greater inclusion of researchers who are speakers of English as an additional language. Recognizing that English linguistic hegemony in science limits participation and productivity, the document proposes multilingual presentation formats, academic writing training, a Virtual Writing Center, language support programs, and writing retreats. Each recommendation is grounded in both pedagogical theory and empirical evidence, with an emphasis on collaborative, socially embedded approaches to scientific writing. The proposed academic writing training integrates constructivist and socio-cultural perspectives, emphasizing genre awareness, rhetorical competence, and reflective practices. The Virtual Writing Center would serve as a permanent infrastructure offering personalized tutoring and peer review support, while the language support programs address ongoing needs through workshops, consultations, and access to language tools. Writing retreats provide immersive environments for focused work and mentorship. The recommendations also encourage ethical use of AI tools for translation and writing assistance, fostering digital literacy alongside linguistic proficiency. Collectively, these initiatives aim to transform language from a barrier into a resource, recognizing multilingualism as an asset in global research collaboration. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, the document advocates for adaptable, community-driven strategies that can evolve within the diverse institutional and disciplinary contexts of the Rubin Research Ecosystem. By implementing these practices, the Ecosystem could lead efforts to democratize scientific communication and foster a more equitable, multilingual research culture.

> **摘要:** Amid the migration of academics from X, the social media platform Bluesky has been proposed as a potential alternative. To assess its viability and relevance for science communication, this study presents the first large-scale analysis of scholarly article dissemination on Bluesky, exploring its potential as a new source of social media metrics. We collected and analysed 87,470 Bluesky posts referencing 72,898 scholarly articles from February 2024 to April 2025, integrating metadata from the OpenAlex database. We examined temporal trends, disciplinary coverage, language use, textual characteristics, and user engagement. A sharp increase in scholarly activity on Bluesky was observed from November 2024, coinciding with broader academic shifts away from X. Posts primarily focus on the social, environmental, and medical sciences and are predominantly written in English. As on X, likes and reposts are much more common than replies and quotes. Nevertheless, Bluesky posts demonstrate a higher degree of textual originality than previously observed on X, suggesting greater interpretive engagement. These findings highlight Bluesky's emerging role as a credible platform for science communication and a promising source for altmetrics. The platform may facilitate not only early visibility of research outputs but also more meaningful scholarly dialogue in the evolving social media landscape.

> **摘要:** Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time). In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

> **摘要:** This article presents a case study comparing the capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence (AI) for visual storytelling. We developed detailed instructions to recreate a three-panel Nancy cartoon strip by Ernie Bushmiller and provided them to both humans and AI systems. The human participants were 20-something students with basic artistic training but no experience or knowledge of this comic strip. The AI systems used were popular commercial models trained to draw and paint like artists, though their training sets may not necessarily include Bushmiller's work. Results showed that AI systems excel at mimicking professional art but struggle to create coherent visual stories. In contrast, humans proved highly adept at transforming instructions into meaningful visual narratives.

> **摘要:** Digital technologies and tools have transformed the way we can study cultural heritage and the way we can recreate it digitally. Techniques such as laser scanning, photogrammetry, and a variety of Mixed Reality solutions have enabled researchers to examine cultural objects and artifacts more precisely and from new perspectives. In this part of the panel, we explore how Virtual Reality (VR) and eXtended Reality (XR) can serve as tools to recreate and visualize the remains of historical cultural heritage and experience it in simulations of its original complexity, which means immersive and interactive. Visualization of material culture exemplified by archaeological sites and architecture can be particularly useful when only ruins or archaeological remains survive. However, these advancements also bring significant challenges, especially in the area of transdisciplinary cooperation between specialists from many, often distant, fields, and the dissemination of virtual immersive environments among both professionals and the general public.

> **摘要:** Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning, shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments, and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks (\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks. Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection depends on user priorities.

> **摘要:** Despite a growing need for spiritual care in the US, it is often under-served, inaccessible, or misunderstood, while almost no prior work in CSCW/HCI research has engaged with professional chaplains and spiritual care providers. This interdisciplinary study aims to develop a foundational understanding of how spiritual care may (or may not) be expanded into online spaces -- especially focusing on anonymous, asynchronous, and text-based online communities. We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study with chaplains (N=22) involving interviews and user testing sessions centered around Reddit support communities to understand participants' perspectives on technology and their ideations about the role of chaplaincy in prospective Online Spiritual Care Communities (OSCCs). Our Grounded Theory Method analysis highlighted benefits of OSCCs including: meeting patients where they are at; accessibility and scalability; and facilitating patient-initiated care. Chaplains highlighted how their presence in OSCCs could help with shaping peer interactions, moderation, synchronous chats for group care, and redirecting to external resources, while also raising important feasibility concerns, risks, and needs for future design and research. We used an existing taxonomy of chaplaincy techniques to show that some spiritual care strategies may be amenable to online spaces, yet we also exposed the limitations of technology to fully mediate spiritual care and the need to develop new online chaplaincy interventions. Based on these findings, we contribute the model of a ``Care Loop'' between institutionally-based formal care and platform-based community care to expand access and drive greater awareness and utilization of spiritual care. We also contribute design implications to guide future work in online spiritual care.

> **摘要:** Over 90% of new vehicles in the United States now collect and transmit telematics data. Similar trends are seen in other developed countries. Transportation planners have previously utilized telematics data in various forms, but its current scale offers significant new opportunities in traffic measurement, classification, planning, and control. Despite these opportunities, the enormous volume of data and lack of standardization across manufacturers necessitates a clearer understanding of the data and improved data processing methods for extracting actionable insights. This paper takes a step towards addressing these needs through four primary objectives. First, a data processing pipeline was built to efficiently analyze 1.4 billion miles (120 million trips) of telematics data collected in Virginia between August 2021 and August 2022. Second, an open data repository of trip and roadway segment level summaries was created. Third, interactive visualization tools were designed to extract insights from these data about trip-taking behavior and the speed profiles of roadways. Finally, major challenges that were faced during processing this data are summarized and recommendations to overcome them are provided. This work will help manufacturers collecting the data and transportation professionals using the data to develop a better understanding of the possibilities and major pitfalls to avoid.

> **摘要:** The efficient design and management of public green spaces is a key factor in promoting the health and well-being of urban population, as emphasized by the WHO, UNEP, and EEA. These areas serve as the "green lungs" of the urban ecosystem, playing a vital role in enhancing quality of life thanks to the provision of ecosystem services. In this context, the Smart Green City use case in Campobasso municipality, funded by the Italian Ministry of Enterprises (MIMIT), emerges as an innovative model for the sustainable management of green urban areas through the adoption of an advanced system of emerging technologies integrated and interoperable. The project integrates IoT systems and data-driven governance platforms, enabling real-time monitoring of the health status of trees and green areas via a Decision Support System (DSS). It also facilitates the collection and analysis of data from diverse sources, including weather conditions, air quality, soil moisture, pollution levels. The resulting cloud-based platform supports a holistic real time decision making for green urban managers, technical experts and operational staff. It enables intelligent control and management of urban green spaces using Tree Talker sensors, integrated with soil moisture and water potential monitoring systems. Thanks to predictive models based on machine learning algorithms and real time data provided by IoT sensors, irrigation of public parks can be optimized by providing suggestions on when and how much water to apply. Customized alerts layers are also activated warning users when monitored parameters, such as soil temperature, humidity, or water potential, exceed predefined thresholds. This Use Case demonstrates how digitalization, IoT sensors fusion and technological innovation can support sustainable urban governance, fostering environmental resilience and improving citizens quality of life.

> **摘要:** The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts raises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluating vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers.
