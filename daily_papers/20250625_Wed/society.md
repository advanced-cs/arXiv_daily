> **摘要:** This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona'' that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems: alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency (maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness (reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2) agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

> **摘要:** This study uses pre-trained LLMs to conduct thematic analysis to investigate disciplinary incidents involving engineers in Quebec, shedding light on critical gaps in engineering education. Through a comprehensive review of the disciplinary register of the Ordre des ing\'enieurs du Qu\'ebec (OIQ)'s disciplinary register for 2010 to 2024, researchers from engineering education and human resources management in technological development laboratories conducted a thematic analysis of reported incidents to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. The analysis aims to uncover the most common types of disciplinary incidents, underlying causes, and implications for the field in how engineering education addresses (or fails to address) these issues. Our findings identify recurring themes, analyze root causes, and offer recommendations for engineering educators and students to mitigate similar incidents. This research has implications for informing curriculum development, professional development, and performance evaluation, ultimately fostering a culture of professionalism and ethical responsibility in engineering. By providing empirical evidence of disciplinary incidents and their causes, this study contributes to evidence-based practices for engineering education and professional development, enhancing the engineering education community's understanding of professionalism and ethics.

>
> **摘要:** This article demonstrates the transformative impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on actuarial science, illustrated by four implemented case studies. It begins with a historical overview of AI, tracing its evolution from early neural networks to modern GenAI technologies. The first case study shows how Large Language Models (LLMs) improve claims cost prediction by deriving significant features from unstructured textual data, significantly reducing prediction errors in the underlying machine learning task. In the second case study, we explore the automation of market comparisons using the GenAI concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to identify and process relevant information from documents. A third case study highlights the capabilities of fine-tuned vision-enabled LLMs in classifying car damage types and extracting contextual information. The fourth case study presents a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes data from a given dataset and generates a corresponding report detailing the key findings. In addition to these case studies, we outline further potential applications of GenAI in the insurance industry, such as the automation of claims processing and fraud detection, and the verification of document compliance with internal or external policies. Finally, we discuss challenges and considerations associated with the use of GenAI, covering regulatory issues, ethical concerns, and technical limitations, among others.

> **摘要:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks, including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration, enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of trustworthy AI systems.

> **摘要:** Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field. Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content, we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs. one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the implications of our findings.

#### [new 008] A Principled Approach to Randomized Selection under Uncertainty

> **摘要:** Many decision-making processes involve evaluating and then selecting items; examples include scientific peer review, job hiring, school admissions, and investment decisions. The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or deliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the items deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and uncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such deterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving explicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in practice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we prove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval estimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient Randomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the worst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty represented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max intervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an interpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method scales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic properties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically compare algorithms on synthetic peer review data. Our experiments demonstrate that MERIT matches the performance of existing algorithms in expected utility under fully probabilistic review data models used in previous work, while outperforming previous methods with respect to our novel worst-case formulation.

> **摘要:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

> **摘要:** Cyber violence severely disrupts public order in both cyberspace and the real world. Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but rely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and macro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance mechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary game model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on evolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government regulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against the online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most desirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was introduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors were considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new SBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo simulations found that increasing the "correct guidance" strategy by the online media reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes for their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time for the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the online media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion, followed by the government's independent "strong regulation." Relying solely on the online media's "correct guidance" produced the weakest effect. Finally, this mechanism was applied to a case study, and a multi-stage, multi-scenario analysis based on life cycle theory enhanced its practical applicability.

> **摘要:** Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities, emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022) revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%. Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting and support evidence-based policymaking.

> **摘要:** This article unpacks the design choices behind longstanding and newly proposed computational frameworks aimed at finding common grounds across collective preferences and examines their potential future impacts, both technically and normatively. It begins by situating AI-assisted preference elicitation within the historical role of opinion polls, emphasizing that preferences are shaped by the decision-making context and are seldom objectively captured. With that caveat in mind, we explore AI-based democratic innovations as discovery tools for fostering reasonable representations of a collective will, sense-making, and agreement-seeking. At the same time, we caution against dangerously misguided uses, such as enabling binding decisions, fostering gradual disempowerment or post-rationalizing political outcomes.

> **摘要:** International aid is a critical mechanism for promoting economic growth and well-being in developing nations, supporting progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, tracking aid contributions remains challenging due to labor-intensive data management, incomplete records, and the heterogeneous nature of aid data. Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, we partnered with government agencies to develop an AI model that complements manual classification and mitigates human bias in subjective interpretation. By integrating SDG-specific semantics and leveraging prior knowledge from language models, our approach enhances classification accuracy and accommodates the diversity of aid projects. When applied to a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years, our model can reveal hidden trends in the temporal evolution of international development cooperation. Expert interviews further suggest how these insights can empower policymakers with data-driven decision-making tools, ultimately improving aid effectiveness and supporting progress toward SDGs.

> **摘要:** Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in comparing model performance with human test takers'. While such benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?) and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?). In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics -- a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency -- into LLM benchmarking. We make four primary contributions. First, we reflect on current LLM benchmark developments and contrast them with psychometrics-based test development. Second, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for {P}sychometrics-{A}ssis{T}ed ben{CH}marking of LLMs. PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations. In particular, PATCH enables valid comparison between LLMs and human populations. Third, we demonstrate PATCH by measuring several LLMs' proficiency in 8th grade mathematics against 56 human populations. We show that adopting a psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those based on current benchmarking practices. Fourth, we release 4 high-quality datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school mathematics and science with human populations.

> **摘要:** Political debates on social media sometimes flare up. From that moment on, users engage much more with one another; their communication is also more emotional and polarised. While it has been difficult to grasp such moments with computational methods, we suggest that trigger points are a useful concept to understand and ultimately model such behaviour. Established in qualitative focus group interviews to understand political polarisation (Mau, Lux, and Westheuser 2023), trigger points represent moments when individuals feel that their understanding of what is fair, normal, or appropriate in society is questioned. In the original studies, individuals show strong and negative emotional responses when certain triggering words or topics are mentioned. Our paper finds that these trigger points also exist in online debates. We examine online deliberations on Reddit between 2020 and 2022 and collect >100 million comments from subreddits related to a set of words identified as trigger points in UK politics. Analysing the comments, we find that trigger words increase user engagement and animosity, i.e., more negativity, hate speech, and controversial comments. Introducing trigger points to computational studies of online communication, our findings are relevant to researchers interested in affective computing, online deliberation, and how citizens debate politics and society in light of affective polarisation.

> **摘要:** Multimodal machine learning (MML) is rapidly reshaping the way mental-health disorders are detected, characterized, and longitudinally monitored. Whereas early studies relied on isolated data streams -- such as speech, text, or wearable signals -- recent research has converged on architectures that integrate heterogeneous modalities to capture the rich, complex signatures of psychiatric conditions. This survey provides the first comprehensive, clinically grounded synthesis of MML for mental health. We (i) catalog 26 public datasets spanning audio, visual, physiological signals, and text modalities; (ii) systematically compare transformer, graph, and hybrid-based fusion strategies across 28 models, highlighting trends in representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Beyond summarizing current capabilities, we interrogate open challenges: data governance and privacy, demographic and intersectional fairness, evaluation explainability, and the complexity of mental health disorders in multimodal settings. By bridging methodological innovation with psychiatric utility, this survey aims to orient both ML researchers and mental-health practitioners toward the next generation of trustworthy, multimodal decision-support systems.

> **摘要:** As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.

> **摘要:** In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

> **摘要:** This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g., motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g., smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use. Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.
